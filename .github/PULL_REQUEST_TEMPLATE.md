- [ ] I ensured that I are not pushing configuration files containing sensitive information such as testing keys.
- [ ] I ensured that large PR is avoided,  Consider splitting if there are more than 500 line changes, In addition to line count, also consider the number of files being affected, An ideal amount is less than 10, 25-30 is generally too large with the exception of library upgrades, refactors, etc.
- [ ] I ensured that If the PR is inevitably large, a short PR review meeting or discuss with reviewers will be organized.
- [ ] I ensured that If the PR is to resolve a blocker, do not make unrelated changes in the same PR e.g. formatting changes, to minimize review time.
- [ ] I ensured that PR is focused
- [ ] I ensured that context was given in the PR description, Include a clear description of the changes
- [ ] I ensured that related github issues are linked, Include screenshots if this will make the context clearer for the reviewer
- [ ] I ensured that "work in progress" or "hold" labels are removed
- [ ] I ensured that adherence to style guidelines
- [ ] I ensured that feature flag is applied if needed
- [ ] I ensured that follow secure development practices
- [ ] I ensured that no secrets or sensitive data have been committed or logged
- [ ] I ensured that no hardcoded values that may change depending on environment (these should be configured dynamically e.g. through environment variables, from the db etc)
