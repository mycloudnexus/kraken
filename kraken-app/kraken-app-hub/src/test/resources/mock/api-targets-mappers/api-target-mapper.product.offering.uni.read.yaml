  description: |
    The Buyer requests a list of POQs from the Seller based on a set of POQ
    filter criteria (as described in MEF79). For each POQ returned, the
    Seller also provides a POQ Identifier that uniquely identifies this POQ
    within the Seller's system. The order of the elements returned to the
    Buyer is defined by the Seller (e.g. natural order) and does not change
    between the pages. If criteria for attribute X are provided, all
    returned items must match it.
